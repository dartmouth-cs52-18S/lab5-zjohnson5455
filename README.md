# Blog Backend (Lab 5 Part 1)

This lab went by far the smoothest of any lab so far. I think this is partly because I was able to visualize the functionality and data flow very easily. I was able to be much more efficient. Now, my lab 4 frontend points to my own backend that contains CRUD functionality. During this lab, I even optimized a part of my lab 4 for speed and performance (editing a post). Everything works and is hosted on Heroku. URL is zjohnsonblog.surge.sh

# Lab 5 Part 2

Based off of comments made in class, I thought this lab was going to be very easy and procrasinated longer than I should have. As such, it was a more stressful lab. I got all authentification features working except displaying the author's name. This is because I was having a weird bug where my author was correctly displaying in the log but would throw errors as undefined when trying to access its properties. It is on the same URL.
